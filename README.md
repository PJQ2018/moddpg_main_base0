# moddpg
This is the code of the moddpg algorithm for UAV-assisted data collection and energy harvesting.

Tensorflow version for the code is 2.0.0 with Python 3.7.

*****

- To train the model:  
    ```python
    python train_ddpg.py
    ```

- To eavluation the trained model:  
     ```python
    python eval.py
    ```
